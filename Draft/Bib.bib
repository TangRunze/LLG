Suppose that everya ij is bounded and for everyi>j we haveEa ij =$\mu$,D 2 a ij =$\sigma$2 andEa ii =v. E. P. Wigner determined the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues ofA (semi-circle law).

We show that with probability 1-o(1)all eigenvalues belong to the above intervalI if $\mu$=0, while in case $\mu$>0 only the largest eigenvalue $\lambda$1 is outsideI, and lambda 1 = fracSigma i,j aij n + fracsigma 2 mu + Oleft( fracIsqrt n right) i.e. $\lambda$1 asymptotically has a normal distribution with expectation (n1)$\mu$+v+($\sigma$2/$\mu$) and variance 2$\sigma$2 (bounded variance!).},

@article{Oliveira2009,
	abstract = {Consider any random graph model where potential edges appear independently, with possibly different probabilities, and assume that the minimum expected degree is omega(ln n). We prove that the adjacency matrix and the Laplacian of that random graph are concentrated around the corresponding matrices of the weighted graph whose edge weights are the probabilities in the random model. While this may seem surprising, we will see that this matrix concentration phenomenon is a generalization of known results about the Er$\backslash$"\{o\}s-R$\backslash$'\{e\}nyi model. In particular, we will argue that matrix concentration is implicit the theory of quasi-random graph properties.   We present two main applications of the main result. In bond percolation over a graph G, we show that the Laplacian of the random subgraph is typically very close to the Laplacian of G. As a corollary, we improve upon a bound for the spectral gap due to Chung and Horn that was derived via much more complicated methods.   In inhomogeneous random graphs, there are points X\_1,...,X\_n uniformly distributed on the interval [0,1] and each pair is connected with probability p kappa(X\_i,X\_j). We show that if $\backslash$ln n/n<< p<< 1 and kappa is bounded, then the adjacency matrix of the random graph is close to an integral operator defined in terms of kappa.   Our main proof tool is a new concentration inequality for matrix martingales that generalizes Freedman's inequality for the standard scalar setting.},
