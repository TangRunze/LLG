  abstract    = "Interest in structural brain connectivity has grown with the
                 understanding that abnormal neural connections may play a role
                 in neurologic and psychiatric diseases. Small animal
                 connectivity mapping techniques are particularly important for
                 identifying aberrant connectivity in disease models. Diffusion
                 magnetic resonance imaging tractography can provide
                 nondestructive, 3D, brain-wide connectivity maps, but has
                 historically been limited by low spatial resolution, low
                 signal-to-noise ratio, and the difficulty in estimating
                 multiple fiber orientations within a single image voxel. Small
                 animal diffusion tractography can be substantially improved
                 through the combination of ex vivo MRI with exogenous contrast
                 agents, advanced diffusion acquisition and reconstruction
                 techniques, and probabilistic fiber tracking. Here, we present
                 a comprehensive, probabilistic tractography connectome of the
                 mouse brain at microscopic resolution, and a comparison of
                 these data with a neuronal tracer-based connectivity data from
                 the Allen Brain Atlas. This work serves as a reference
                 database for future tractography studies in the mouse brain,
                 and demonstrates the fundamental differences between
                 tractography and neuronal tracer data.",

We show that with probability 1-o(1)all eigenvalues belong to the above intervalI if $\mu$=0, while in case $\mu$>0 only the largest eigenvalue $\lambda$1 is outsideI, and lambda 1 = fracSigma i,j aij n + fracsigma 2 mu + Oleft( fracIsqrt n right) i.e. $\lambda$1 asymptotically has a normal distribution with expectation (n1)$\mu$+v+($\sigma$2/$\mu$) and variance 2$\sigma$2 (bounded variance!).},

@article{Oliveira2009,
	abstract = {Consider any random graph model where potential edges appear independently, with possibly different probabilities, and assume that the minimum expected degree is omega(ln n). We prove that the adjacency matrix and the Laplacian of that random graph are concentrated around the corresponding matrices of the weighted graph whose edge weights are the probabilities in the random model. While this may seem surprising, we will see that this matrix concentration phenomenon is a generalization of known results about the Er$\backslash$"\{o\}s-R$\backslash$'\{e\}nyi model. In particular, we will argue that matrix concentration is implicit the theory of quasi-random graph properties.   We present two main applications of the main result. In bond percolation over a graph G, we show that the Laplacian of the random subgraph is typically very close to the Laplacian of G. As a corollary, we improve upon a bound for the spectral gap due to Chung and Horn that was derived via much more complicated methods.   In inhomogeneous random graphs, there are points X\_1,...,X\_n uniformly distributed on the interval [0,1] and each pair is connected with probability p kappa(X\_i,X\_j). We show that if $\backslash$ln n/n<< p<< 1 and kappa is bounded, then the adjacency matrix of the random graph is close to an integral operator defined in terms of kappa.   Our main proof tool is a new concentration inequality for matrix martingales that generalizes Freedman's inequality for the standard scalar setting.},
